1. Each char string in the CRA_Account class occupies 41 bytes in memory. Each character in this array takes 1 byte each. We can store 40 meaningful characters in those arrays, meaning 1 byte is left for the null terminator. the '\0' identifies end of the char string.



2. C++ allows overloading functions. In this case, we overloaded member function 'set'. This is allowed because each of the definitions of 'set' has a different signature. C++ compiler matches client code with the corresponding 'set' implementation by recognizing types of the functions' signature. 



3. I explored privacy in the context of encapsulation, understanding for the first time what this means to hide data from the client code to ensure integrity of the application design.
