 1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?
    
1) Safe empty state it's a state of an object through which we prevent the client code from accessing data in an instance of object with no valid data in it. 



2) I extracted the validation logic from the 5 parameter constructor and wrote two separate member functions to perform validation on name/destination strings and date as well as setting an empty state in both of them.


3) canTravelWith(...) member function can access private data member of another instance of an object with the current object because privacy of an object remains within its class.


    
4) strncpy(...) requires index number of the last copied character to prevent for overwriting memory beyond an array's size.




5) Writing constructors to expand interface of an object, allowing initialization of an object with various use cases;
Extracting and localizing repetitive code to avoid code duplication for easier maintainability it's a vital skill in becoming a programmer. In fact, often employers don't want to hire just programers but rather an engineers who write code strategically.
